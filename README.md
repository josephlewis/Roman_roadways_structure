# Process-Explicit Model Reveals Structure of Roman Roadways in the Roman Empire

This repository contains all the data and scripts required to fully reproduce all analyses presented in the paper "_Process-Explicit Model Reveals Structure of Roman Roadways in the Roman Empire_" authored by **Lewis**, J.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Open project using Roman_roadways_structure.Rproj to ensure relative paths work.
2. Run the 00_Main R script in the R folder to reproduce the analysis.
   * _01_tactical_sim.R_ generates 62 simulated routes with known parameter values
   * _02_ABC_tactical_sim.R_ fits the Bayesian hierarchical movement model to the 62 simulated routes
   * _03_analyse_ABC_tactical_sim.R_ produces summary tables and figures for the tactical simulation
   * _04_ABC_RR_known.R_ fits the Bayesian hierarchical movement model to the 62 known Roman roadways in Wales
   * _05_analyse_ABC_RR_known.R_ produces summary tables and figures for the Roman roadways analysis
   * _06_roadways_critical_slopes.R_ produces mathematical slope gradient figures for the Roman roadways analysis
   * _07_roadways_empire_slopes.R_ produces summary tables and figures for Roman roadways across the Roman empire

**Data**
1. DEM
  * _OS_50m_Wales.tif_ - Ordnance Survey 50 metre Digital Elevation Model of Wales
2. extent
  * _roman_empire_ad_117.gpkg_ - Extent of the Roman empire.
2. _RR_known.gpkg_ - 62 Known Roman roadways digitised from 'Roman frontiers in Wales and the Marchesâ€™

**Output**
1. tactical_simuation
  * _simulated_routes_ - simulated routes produced via _01_tactical_sim.R_
  * _simulated_routes_abc_ - fitted least-cost paths to the 62 simulated routes using the Bayesian hierarchical movement model
2. _simulated_roads_ - fitted least-cost paths to the 62 known Roman roadways using the Bayesian hierarchical movement model
3. _tables_
  * tactical_simulation
      * _sim_routes_abc_posterior_summary1.csv_ - estimated b parameter for the 62 simulated routes
      * _sim_routes_abc_posterior_summary2.csv_ - estimated b bar parameter for population-level simulated routes
  * simulated_roads
      * _road_sims_posterior_summary_1.csv_ - estimated b parameter for 62 known Roman roadways
      * _sim_routes_abc_posterior_summary2.csv_ - estimated b bar parameter for population-level Roman roadways across the Roman empire
      * _road_sims_posterior_summary_3.csv_ - Path Deviation Index for 62 known Roman roadways
      * _road_sims_posterior_median_slope_gradient.csv_ - mathematical slope gradients for 62 known Roman roadways
     * road_sims_posterior_median_slope_gradient_max.csv_ - Maximum mathematical slope gradient for 62 known Roman roadways
4. roadway_system
  *  _road_sims_posterior_median.gpkg_ - 62 least-cost paths based on the estimated median posterior b value for each Roman roadway in Wales
  *  tobler_routes.gpkg_ - 62 least-cost paths based on Tobler's Hiking Function (parameter b = 3.5)

**Analysis**

Please note that running the Bayesian hierarchical movement model via _02_ABC_tactical_sim.R_ or _04_ABC_RR_known.R_ has a long processing time and high memory requirements. The calculation of 250,000 least-cost paths for each of the 62 simulated routes / known Roman roadways (15,500,000 least-cost paths in total) takes approximtely 4 days to complete when using 85 cores and ~50GB memory. 

Fitted Bayesian hierarchical movement model to the 62 known Roman roads and simulated routes are available in the _Output_ folder.
1. tactical_simuation
  * _simulated_routes_abc_ - fitted least-cost paths to the 62 simulated routes using the Bayesian hierarchical movement model
2. _simulated_roads_ - fitted least-cost paths to the 62 known Roman roadways using the Bayesian hierarchical movement model
